Hey Andrei, Thanks for the feedback I did understand all the changes that you made except 
the last part about the division and 0: 

  if (operator === '/' && item === 'second') {
      return giveNum(item, true);  (This return here I don't quite understand)
    } else {
      return giveNum(item);
    }

also the part that you assign 4 parameters so I didn't change mine yet.
